it happened in that pointless town
open to the winds
constantly sweeping through
or was I just there at the wrong time?
such a damp place
damp and windy 
decaying in the rain and wind
bits of plaster and stone crumbling from the walls
really
facade fragments crunching under the soles
everything is disintegrating in real time
stone crumbles and wood rots
a lot of private houses too
huddling together in the wind
and then one day I went for a walk
decided to let the wind carry me
so I walked aimlessly
in a pointless town &#x2596 this is the only sensible way to move &#x2594
meandering through huddled wooden houses along the cobblestone roads
suddenly a giant building of yellow and white blocks appeared in front of me
first I thought it was some sort of a factory 
but it turned out to be a theatre instead
a theatre in such a small town
and in the suburbs too
among the sheds by the river &#x2596 where the foul wind was howling
I was standing there in front of the theatre
a godforsaken building
with no signs of life
they probably give one performance a year here
then I noticed a poster
some exhibition
so I stepped in
there was nothing better to do anyway
I was the only person there
except for the two elderly lady guards
they turned on the lights in the halls
I walked around
footsteps echoing around me
indeed &#x2596 beautiful southern landscapes &#x2596 vibrant colours
FEZ &#x2596 CANNES &#x2596 AGRA
the artist was probably a local &#x2596 but had moved away
which is understandable &#x2596 totally understandable
he hadn’t painted his hometown
but then I discovered a painting from behind the corner
achromatic tones &#x2596 makes sense
the colour of wind ranges from white to black around here
but there &#x2596 in the middle of the snowfield &#x2596 among the old shabby houses
were two people &#x2596 two stick figures
like exclamation marks turned upside down
one of them red &#x2596 the other blue
one standing with her back to the other
I was suddenly struck by a wave of sorrow for some reason
and my mood wasn’t that great to begin with
so I decided to go head back
I don’t know why I became so sad all of a sudden
not even the wind could’ve blown it away back then
not even the water &#x2596 splashing over the quay

.
was it YOU?                                              
was it YOU that I saw?
later I started to think
that it was actually quite a decent painting
meticulously drawn stick figures
if one could say so
human nature conveyed in a single brushstroke
accidentally resembling you
or did it really look like you after all?
I remember
you were wearing that beautiful coat
with big buttons
also blue
but darker
not light blue like the stick figure
.
//A-2B
.
with big buttons
like way back then
also blue
but darker
not light like the stick figure
.
//A-3A
.
WAIT 
were you really wearing that blue coat that day?
how can I not remember?
sometimes I can’t even remember your face anymore
how can it be?
was it the coat?
anyway &#x2596 it was something heavy
but was it the dark one with the big blue buttons?
it wasn’t, was it?
NO IT WASN’T!
you had already given it away
that’s right &#x2596 it wasn’t
but what was it then?
why did that blue bother me so much?
or maybe it wasn’t the blue colour after all?
maybe it was the landscape that affected me somehow
that black and white landscape
everything that remains between black and white
.
//A-3B
.
everything that remains between black and white
.
//A-4A
.
I guess it was really the same as in that painting
a thin layer of snow
the kind that makes all living things wither away
so that the soil begins to shine through
it shines through the snow
we stood there &#x2596 just the two of us
did I recognise the snow from back then in that painting?
wait
.
//A-4B
the kind that makes all living things wither away
so that the soil begins to shine through
shine through the snow
we stood there &#x2596 alone &#x2596 just the two of us
did I recognise the snow from back then in that painting?
wait
but no
it wasn't the snow
there wasn’t any snow after all
it was April
April
two days after my birthday
.
//A-5A
.
so there was no layer of snow &#x2596
the only layer was the one covering me
no
wait
you were also standing with your back to me &#x2596 weren’t you?
the blue stick figure was standing with her back to the red one
.
//A-5B
.
they stood side by side &#x2596 but not facing each other
the blue one had turned away from the red
straightening herself up and pushing her belly out
as if to start walking away
the red one could have been too hot 
and so was I
or rather &#x2596 am
MR HOTHEAD &#x2594
as your mother used to say
oh &#x2596 the things I said to you back then
I shouldn’t have
I SHOULDN’T HAVE
GODDAMNIT
but what’s the use of talking about it now
you also lied &#x2596
saying that you had someone else
but you didn’t
not before the summer
you may not even remember
the things we said
you were cold
you exuded coldness
you turned your back to me
and walked away without saying a word
.
//A-6A
.
and it doesn’t get any easier
still doesn’t
not at all
you go
you went
without looking back
you might’ve been wearing something red instead
but that could’ve come from my gaze
I could have almost hit you
you said something
something about you having reached a point where there’s no turning back
and yet you did
just without me
you turned your back
but no
it wasn’t
wait
WAIT
April
what the
.
//A-6B
.
what the
.
//A-7A
.
no
was it a joke?
it can’t be
when is his birthday
that kid of yours?
in October?
isn’t it?
or am I confusing him with someone else?
this could easily be the case
this can’t be
he
what
I have seen him &#x2594
twice
not more
I know nothing about him really
he plays volleyball &#x2596 I think
dark hair like yours
but what if it was in October?
maybe it was?
did I really think of that? 
was THIS what I saw?
that
the strange and elegant stick figure
had pushed out her belly
wait &#x2596 was it because of the belly?
.
//A-8A
.
why haven’t I thought of it before
that if it was indeed in October
then it’s obvious
so damn obvious
how can it be &#x2596 that I never &#x2594
but maybe I have?
or indeed not?
it never crossed my mind that
.
//A-8B
.
what if
he were mine
OURS
but if I’ve never thought of it &#x2596 then why?
why?
how could I have missed something like that
it was right in front of me and I missed it
.
//A-9A
.
WHAT IF
HE WERE MINE?
sounds familiar
and yet it doesn’t
as if it were my own thought
but not quite
what if &#x2594
&#x259f
I wish I hadn’t seen you last month
after twenty years
did I escape?
did I run away
to this windswept place
this crumbling town
from you
and you followed
you climbed into that painting
and turned your back on me &#x2596 again

I don’t know what came over me
I went and broke a small twig off the Christmas tree
a little twig from the tree that was already sawn into pieces
later I began to wonder &#x2594
what had caused such a strange moment of weakness
oh well &#x2596 I was in a foreign city
the only Estonian on the team
it was after Christmas
and maybe I felt a bit lonely
although it would’ve been sad at home too
Sander has been living with his wife for two months now
so the house would feel empty with or without me
.
maybe it was because I had become used to
seeing that Christmas tree from the hotel window
a magnificent view
over the town hall square
the tree was shining and sparkling
with electric candles glowing around the clock
for the whole month
so maybe I was simply shocked
to find some men hustling around the tree
with a cherry picker &#x2596 dragging off decorations
like stripping a person of their clothes
before a public execution
I was startled by the comparison myself &#x2594
where did such a crazy thought come from?
.
DADDY!
.
//B-2
.
I’m no green deal enthusiast &#x2596 you know
all this talk about the destruction of our environment
and renewable energy
is just to fill the pockets of some corporations
.
COME ON
DON’T CRY NOW!
.
//B-3
.
I have nothing against chopping down some Christmas trees
for a long time &#x2596 we’ve had this tradition
of putting up a Christmas tree in our living room
and somewhere around the 10th of January
I brought an axe from the shed
and chopped the tree into pieces
.
HEY &#x2596 WHY ARE YOU CRYING?
IT’S NOTHING!
.
//B-4
.
it had dried up by then anyway
the whole place was full of spruce needles
they were between the floor boards and in the corners
you could even find some from between the bed sheets
long after the snow had melted
.
DADDY
PLEASE DON’T!
.
//B-5
.
so I’m not some kind of a tree hugger
I’m more of a pragmatic man myself
.
PLEASE-PLEASE!
.
//B-6
.
but for some reason it made me terribly sad
to see them wreck that beautiful Christmas tree
.
COME ON &#x2596 IT WILL BE OVER IN NO TIME
I TOLD YOU IT’S NOTHING
.
//B-7
.
one day they just turned off the lights
and took down the decorations
the next day they came back
and cut the tree into pieces
.
ENOUGH
DON’T CRY OVER SUCH A SMALL THING
.
//B-8
.
I had a meeting early in the morning
I ordered a taxi
and watched how they began to saw the tree
.
COME ON
REAL MEN DON’T CRY &#x2596 YOU KNOW
DO YOU HEAR ME?
.
//B-9
.
from the bottom upwards
branch by branch
.
THAT DOES IT!
.
//B-10
.
when I came back in the evening 
there was only a heap of branches left
back when the tree was still standing
in its full glory
people would actually stop
and take photos in front of it
but now they just stepped over its remains
and I don’t know what came over me
I went over to the heap of branches
and broke off a twig
.
YOU HEAR ME?
.
//B-11
.
I put it in my coat pocket
and left it there for the whole day
the next day when I was about to leave my room
I found the twig in my pocket
.
GODDAMNIT
I SAID
THAT’S ENOUGH!
.
//B-12
.
I was wondering what to do with it
maybe I should just throw it away
but then I thought &#x2594
that since I’d gone through the trouble of picking it up
why should I get rid of it straight away
.
WHAT THE HELL!
NOW YOU START PROTECTING HIM
BECAUSE OF A FREAKING DEAD TREE?!
.
//B-13
.
I took a small bottle of vodka from the minibar
poured out the drink
filled the bottle with tap water
and stuck the twig in it
.
ALL RIGHT
NEXT YEAR I’ll LEAVE IT HERE TO DRY THEN
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
A CORPSE IN THE LIVING ROOM!
.
//B-14
.
now I don’t even know
what to do with it
maybe it will take root?
.
FUCK
I’M NOT ANGRY
IT’S JUST THAT
JESUS CHRIST
DON’T BE SUCH A BABY!
.
//B-15
.
if it does &#x2596 I’ll take it home with me
and plant it in the garden
.
TO HELL WITH IT &#x2596 I’VE HAD ENOUGH!
.
//B-16
.
I’ll tell Sander &#x2594
that it’s in memory of his mother
or that now we have our own Christmas tree
and there’s no need to cut it down anymore

it often happens to me that
when I’m at a party and start telling others
about some ancient event
there is always someone
who attended the same event
but remembers it quite differently
so when I mentioned it to her
and she didn’t seem to understand at first
what I was going on about
I tried to explain to her that
I believe it was she who had told me
about how she had also noticed
that I tend to exaggerate my memories
yet she didn’t want to agree with me and claimed
that even the word EXAGGERATE sounds weird to her
like it’s not even a word she would use
to which I replied
that I was pretty sure it was she who had told me
that I often add colourful details to things that have actually happened
and then forget about it myself
and that I’ve fantasized about my memories like that
and she repeated that
she doesn’t remember telling me any of it
although I was pretty sure she did
so then she wanted to know WHEN
to which I replied
that how should I know
maybe recently or a bit earlier
I don’t write such things down in my diary
and then she enquired as to
why she would’ve said something like that in the first place
but I didn’t quite understand
what she meant by that
so then she asked
about WHICH event had we actually talked about
and I had to admit that I didn’t quite remember
only that it had happened at a gathering
so she immediately asked which gathering it was
and I was a bit lost again
’cause I can’t remember every little detail
but then I got really interested in the matter
and a bit annoyed as well
so I wanted to know
if she really didn’t remember
to which she admitted that she wasn’t sure
although she does know
that she has been thinking
about my tendency to exaggerate
and that the older my memories get
and the farther they are removed from me
the more colours I tend to add
not to all of them &#x2596 of course
but to some
like when I once started telling her
about the sauna party
on her twentieth birthday
where we
were both quite drunk
and almost drowned in the sauna pool
yet she doesn’t recall going to the sauna
or even taking a shower
but drinking juice for the whole night instead
and she also said that she doesn’t remember
us talking about that memory recently
I sighed and said
that it wasn’t even that specific memory I had in mind
to which she asked which one I had meant then
but I decided not to admit that I couldn’t remember
because it didn’t actually matter
what I really would’ve liked to tell her was
that she was probably right
I do tend to add colour to my memories
but this simply comes from the fact
that my life has been
at least in my own opinion
quite colourful to begin with
so who cares if I misremember a few things
or even forget some entirely
because the colours themselves won’t be forgotten
